    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Puff Pastry</li>
      <li>Nutella</li>
      <li>Egg</li>
      <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prep.</strong> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li><strong>Roll out dough.</strong> Once the sheets of puff pastry have thawed place them on a lightly floured surface. Roll out each sheet with a rolling pin into an even size. Be careful not to make the dough too thin, you just want to spread it into a slightly larger rectangle.</li>
      <li><strong>Add Nutella.</strong> Next add the Nutella to one of the sheets of dough. Spread evenly until the entire sheet is covered. Place the other sheet of puff pastry carefully on top. Make sure the sheets line up and the Nutella is covered as best as possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Slice.</strong> Cut the pastry dough into 12 strips, about 1/2 inch thick with a sharp knife or pizza cutter. You will make horizontal slices, going from one of the long edges of the rectangle to the other long edge.</li>
      <li><strong>Shape Nutella puff pastries.</strong> To create puff pastry Nutella twists hold a strip of pastry, one hand on either end. Then gently twirl the dough strip in opposite directions with each hand.</li>
